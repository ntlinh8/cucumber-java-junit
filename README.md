# Cucumber Java JUnit Framework

Welcome to the Cucumber Java JUnit Framework repository! This repository provides a framework for behavior-driven development (BDD) testing using Cucumber, a popular tool for writing human-readable scenarios in plain text, and JUnit, a testing framework for the Java programming language.

## Introduction

Cucumber is a tool that supports BDD by allowing developers and testers to write feature files containing scenarios in a natural language format. These feature files are then executed against the application under test using step definitions written in programming languages such as Java, which interact with the application through automation.

JUnit is a widely-used testing framework for Java applications, providing annotations and assertions to facilitate the writing and execution of unit tests. When combined with Cucumber, JUnit serves as the test runner for executing Cucumber scenarios and reporting test results.

This repository provides a template for setting up a Cucumber Java JUnit testing framework, including the necessary dependencies, configuration files, and example feature files and step definitions to get started with BDD testing.

## Features

- **Feature Files**: Write feature files using Gherkin syntax to define behavior-driven scenarios in plain text.
- **Step Definitions**: Implement step definitions in Java to translate Gherkin steps into executable code.
- **Parameterization**: Parameterize scenarios using examples tables and scenario outline templates to test multiple variations of the same scenario.
- **Hooks**: Use Cucumber hooks to define setup and teardown actions that run before or after scenarios, features, or entire test runs.
- **Tags**: Organize scenarios using tags to selectively run subsets of tests based on specific criteria.
- **Reporting**: Generate comprehensive test reports with detailed information about test results, including passed, failed, and skipped scenarios.

## Setup

To set up the Cucumber Java JUnit Framework locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/ntlinh8/cucumber-java-junit.git
```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary dependencies, including Java Development Kit (JDK), Cucumber, JUnit, and any additional libraries or tools required for your specific testing needs.

3. **Configuration**: Configure any necessary settings or parameters in the framework, such as browser configurations, test data sources, or reporting options.

## Writing Tests

Once the framework is set up, you can start writing BDD tests using Cucumber feature files and Java step definitions. Here are some key points to keep in mind:

- **Feature Files**: Create feature files (*.feature) using Gherkin syntax to describe the behavior of the application from the end user's perspective.
- **Step Definitions**: Implement step definitions in Java to map each step in the feature files to executable code that interacts with the application under test.
- **Parameterization**: Use examples tables and scenario outlines to test different input values and scenarios within the same feature file.

## Running Tests

To execute the automated tests using the Cucumber Java JUnit Framework, follow these steps:

1. **Compile**: Compile the Java code to ensure that all necessary files are compiled correctly.

2. **Run Tests**: Use JUnit to execute the test suites defined in the framework. Alternatively, you can run individual test classes or methods directly from your integrated development environment (IDE).

3. **Review Reports**: After the tests have completed execution, review the test execution reports generated by JUnit or any custom reporting libraries integrated into the framework.
